# README

This is a fairly basic rails application.  It is written using Rails 5.0 and Ruby 2.2.2

To get started, create a new postgresql database and update the
sample database.yml.  note that the sample is not a postgres yml and
you'll have to change that

To get started just pull down the application and run

    bundle exec rake db:migrate

    bundle exec rails s

And you should be good to go with a blank database at localhost:3000
